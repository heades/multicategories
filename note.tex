\maketitle  

In categorical logic it is customary to model sequents of the form
$A_1,\ldots,A_n \vdash B$ in a monoidal category as morphism $f :
\interp{A_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \interp{A_n} \to \interp{B}$.  For
example, modeling propositional intuitionistic logic requires the
monoidal category to be at least cartesian, and $\otimes$ to be the
cartesian product, while modeling a sequent in propositional linear
logic requires only tensor.  This works well, but what if the logic
one is seeking to model categorically does not have a suitable notion
of a tensor product that can model the left-hand side of sequents?
Then the notion of a multicategory just might be the structure
suitable for such a model.

In an ordinary category morphisms have by definition only a single
source object and a single target object.  Multicategories generalize
morphisms to have multiple source objects denoted $f : X_1,\ldots,X_n
\to Y$.
